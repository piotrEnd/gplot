**Information architecture:**

A dedicated property website for a spacious plot near Poznan. The main page highlights a captivating panoramic photo showcasing the property for sale. Since it's a private seller, minimal contact information is intentionally provided. The information section provides a description, specifications, a map, and a drone video. The gallery showcases aerial photography

**Design:**

Generous white space enhances readability and subtly conveys a non-pushy sales approach. The complete webpage is structured to eliminate any possible sources of distraction. Instead of a fixed navigation, users can readily access the menu at any time by clicking the scroll-up button. The use of the Poiret One font for headlines conveys a sense of sophistication, while the Encode Sans font ensures remarkable readability for body text.
