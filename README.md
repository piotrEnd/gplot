**Information architecture and design:**

I have created and deployed 'property website' for a large plot near Poznan in order to reach wide online audience apart from efforts of estate agency. Main page has great panoramic photo showing the object of sale with intriguing font on top and intentionally skimpy contact data (private seller). Next view provides description, specs, map and drone video. Gallery holds aerial photograpy. In addition, I supervised shooting and filming.

**Design:**

A lot of whitespace improves readability and subconsciously communicate non-pushy sales approach. The whole informational content is made-to-measure in order to eliminate any distractions. Instead of fixed navigation, user has possibility to get quickly the menu by clicking on scroll-up-button.
